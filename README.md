# Shoppin-Cart

Project: Simple Shopping Cart

Description:
A program that simulates a basic shopping cart. The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can add items to their cart, view the cart's contents, and calculate the total cost of their purchases. You will use variables to store cart items and prices, constants to define operation symbols, and work with arrays/slices to manage the cart's contents.

Key Concepts:

- Loops: Use of a loop to repeatedly interact with the user and manage the cart.
- Variables: Stored cart items, prices, and user input.
- Constants: Defined constants for operation symbols and default values.
- Values: Handling numerical values for calculating costs.
- Arrays/Slices: Use of arrays or slices to manage cart items.
